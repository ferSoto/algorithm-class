# FizzBuzz

Today, I read that 199 out of 200 fresh graduated from Computer Science fails in solving this problem. So, I decided to give it a try. Still don't know what's the problem. I think, that place where I read it was exaggerating.

FizzBuzz ask you to print the numbers from 1 to 100, but when a number is multiple of 3, you should print _Fizz_, when multiple of 5, _Buzz_, and, if the number is multiple of both 3 and 5, print _FizzBuzz_.

[This question](https://www.quora.com/Are-there-really-programmers-with-computer-science-degrees-who-cannot-pass-the-FizzBuzz-test) is the one who started it all.
