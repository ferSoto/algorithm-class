# Mergesort

One of my favorites algorithms of all time, if not my favorite one. This folder contains two implementations of mergesort. The first one writen in [Haskell](mergesort.hs) and the last in [C++](mergesort.cpp).

Also, there is a [random number generator](random_number_generator.py) written in Python.
