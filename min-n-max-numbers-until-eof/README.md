On the comments' section of their Facebook post, there were people gatekeeping programming, making really obnoxious comments like, and I quote, "Anyone can code, but being a Software engineer only people with bachelor degrees...". Another guy was also complaining about people without a CS degree "If you ask them to get the min of three number, they can't even get it right", but when he was asked how would he solve the problem he wrote:

```
Si num1<= num2 y num1<=num3 entonces num1 es el menor
Si num2<=num1 y num2<=num3 entonces num2 es el menor
Si num3<= num1 y num3<=num2 entonces num3 es el menor
```

Which is not wrong but, for someone gatekeeping it, it's pretty bad. So I decided to give it a try and see how I'd solve it.

Don't be a gatekeeper, let people try and enjoy coding (and whatever they want to do).
