This programs obtains the two prime numbers which sum is equal to n, where n is even.

Goldbach's conjeture details can be found on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldbach%27s_conjecture), but it basically says that any even number (greater than 2) can be represented as the sum of two prime numbers.

This code is my solution to the problem [Prime Sum](https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/prime-sum/) from [interviewbit.com](https://www.interviewbit.com/).
